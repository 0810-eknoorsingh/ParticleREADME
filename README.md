# ParticleREADME
This is a README File for the assignment I have made on particle system in blender software. It has a brief description about the animation. Hope you find this useful.

## Step By Step procedure how i made the animation using blender....

1) Firstly I appended the bullet model and camera movement and deleted the previous camera and cube.
2) Then I added the plain and adjusted the dimensions and subdivided it into 50 cuts and sccaled it.
3) Then changed the texture into the clouds and shaded smooth.
4) Afterwards I added the cube and adjusted its dimensions as same as the previous plain.
5) Then added a material to the plain which has a aearial sand texture from polyhaven by appending it to the blender file then scaled it.
6) Then gave a blue color to the other plain which is blue to show the effect of water, adjust it according to the position of lamp.
7) Then bullet model is selected and input 2 empty objects from where the bullet will travel to specify the path of the bullet.
8) Then added a icosphere, scaled it and particles are set to 20000 and set the particels and changed the gravity so that it will give the real bubble effect underwater.
9) Then adjust the physics acoording to you to add random movements.
10) Then add the texture and color to the particles. 
11) Select the strength of the particles to give it a realistic look.
12) Then adjust the starting and ending point according to the camera movements so it captures the movements.
13) Then duplicate the bullet model hierarchy in the scene collection and adjust them according to the camera movements.(Note:- I duplicated it for 8 times but you can do it how many times do you want.)
14) Now give glass material to each bubble in shading option.
15) Now set the render settings to 24fps and select the FFmeg format to render and in the encoding select video type to mpeg-4 and quality to pereptually lossless.
16) You can choose engine of your choice and i used cycles you can choose whichever you want.

### So that's pretty much it about the animation on the particel system.
